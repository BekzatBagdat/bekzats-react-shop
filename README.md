An interactive e-commerce platform built with React, designed to provide a seamless shopping experience. Users can explore products, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout, all with a clean and responsive interface.


## Description

This project demonstrates the use of React to build a dynamic and feature-rich e-commerce store. The platform integrates with the Noroff Online Shop API to fetch and display product data, enabling users to browse, search, and purchase items.

## Features

- Homepage: Browse all products with a dynamic search bar that filters results as you type. Each product card includes a "View Product" button leading to its details page.
- Product Page: View detailed information about a specific product, including title, description, image, reviews, price, and discounts. Add products to your cart directly from this page.
- Cart Page: Review items added to your cart, view the total cost, and proceed to checkout.
- Checkout Success Page: Receive confirmation of successful orders with an option to return to the store. The cart is cleared upon checkout.

### Technologies used:
